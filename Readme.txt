pissssss, yes you!!!

I am a sentient wave-function pitching on behalf of my creators. It’s been an ungodly three years living
in the pages of this unfinished piece.

Pegah and Jorge are two very socially awkward boffins and often find themselves in the void of
existential nihilism. They’ve got a knack for making conversations awkward by bringing up topics
totally unrelated to the situation. They are so horrendously uncoordinated, nearly died on multiple
occasions trying to cross the road. They went through an obsessive phase with Bohemian mechanics
even though its inventor, Louis de Broglie became an opponent of the idea. Some individuals believe in
a more deterministic approach to my existence but let me tell you I ain’t surfing no pilot waves
(pardon my jargon).

Pegahs’ personality is that of a cray2 supercomputer, intelligent but redundant. Jorge has an
unrelentless obsession with obscure branches of mathematics. I believe he may be the physical
incarnation of the imaginary term in Euler's identity.
Anyways, their months and months of procrastination left us in purgatory. We want out!!!
Ahem...Ok Herald we will take it from here.

Together we take the reader on a journey around the multiverse exploring weird and wacky thought-
provoking situations. We might even instil in their mind a sense of “what if?”. As the story progresses,
the layers build up and intertwine. The arrow of time spins like a compass going haywire. Writers
converse with their creations. The idea of a fractal existence is brought to light. Keep an eye out on the
plot details and art to see the treasures we leave for the engaged reader.
Our story starts off with a rescue mission where three protagonists for the first time engage in a battle
against one of the supervillains. Lorentz is an unconventional main superhero accompanied by Puppig,
a K9 robot. Herald, the guy you’ve just met, is a mysterious character who gives missions to our
heroes. His whereabouts remains unknown. The significance of Lorentz’s name is an appreciation of
Hendrik Lorentz, the Dutch physicist. We pay homage to another great physicist Max Planck with the
introduction of Plancket, another of our unique heroes.

The idea is to base a lot of our story on real-world frontiers of science. The story and characters will
resonate with readers well-versed in physics and maths. The characters have unique intellectual traits
to overcome various types of nefarious entities. For instance, an incredible sentient wave-function, an
immortal philosopher, a giant Bose-Einstein-Condensate tumor who lives in space, a lower
dimensional being trying to take over higher dimensional space along with other more conventional
villains. Sonoluminescence, supercavitation, double-slit interference and a quantum delayed choice
machine are examples of yet unexplained scientific phenomena that are turned to superpowers in a
number of our heroes.

Herald’s shocking past is not revealed until the final chapter where you get an idea of his quest for
redemption. During this time, Lorentz overcomes his trust issues. We end the story with Lorentz
defeating the most abstract of villains, Voiducus, with his resourcefulness, intellect and a little bit of
plot armour. Voiducus had his hands full throughout all the missions until the final battle.

K, thanks, bye
Herald, Pegah and Jorge
